# How multiple users can edit sequentially in a Word document using Syncfusion Word processor
This demo illustrates how multiple users can edit sequentially in a Word document using Syncfusion Word processor component (Document editor) in your Web application. 

At present Syncfusion Word processor component doesn't support collaborative editing functionality (edit simultaneously). The users are allowed one by one to edit the same document, the demo follows a check-in and check-out state for each document. So, a document can be edited by only one user at a time.

   User name - Password
1. User1     - User1
2. User2     - User2
3. Author    - Author
